Fun fantasy football stuff

## Welcome!

Here is [a guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ldU5fMdI5kooFcXvE5M2IFcBW-fx3N5arZpoaGkmz9E/edit?usp=sharing) to get started with these programs

## League Setup

When using Bench_Points to calculate how many points someone left on the bench in a given week, you need to input your ESPN league's information.

If your league is private, then you need to find your swID and s2 on the ESPN page.

With all of this installed correctly, you should be able to run the program on your own machine. It takes a few min to spit everything out because of the way that ESPN's APIs are set up (the necessary iteration is massive).

Have fun! Reach out if you have any questions or create an issue.
